It's a brand new year 2021!

While I took time to be with family, children and friends, I'm proud to complete the Introduction to Probability and Data with R offered by Duke University. The course was definitely challenging and covered topics like principals of experimental design, summary statistics, conditional probability, probability of independent and non-independent events, statistical computation and data visualisation with R. 
Below is a sample of my (very raw and amateurish) Data Analysis Project. 

To recap the year 2020, I've completed a total of 5 statistical intensive courses on Coursera and Udacity. I decided to embark on this journey to get better at data analysis and I did!

- Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure by Udacity
- Intro to Statistics by Udacity
- Introduction to Data Analysis Using Excel by Rice X Coursera
- Basic Data Descriptors, Statistical Distributions, and Application to Business Decisions by Rice X Coursera
- Introduction to Probability and Data with R by Duke X Coursera

I've read and reread explanations from Khan academy, Mathisfun, and Statistics How To (Stephanie Glen) that have helped me.
